+ redux based
+ [DraftJS](https://draftjs.org/)

### resize container view by dragging boundary [parent](user-story/user-can-view-a-thinkope)
+ [ ] get container view to show a line separating the contained views
+ [ ] detect hover over line
    + allow line to be dragged left or right
+ [ ] on drag complete, propagate update
    + update URL with new split
        + this may be involved, but it's a great model for updating view-only data

### think about internal data structure
+ see /tech
